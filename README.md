## Development Workflow (credits to jovyn)
DO NOT WORK on the main branch directly!

Follow the format of  "name/what-you-are-doing"

e.g. leah/fix-api 

- git command to create a new branch:
  - git checkout main 
  - git checkout -b leah/fix-api (-b creates a new branch)

- git command to move to branch one already created:
  - git checkout leah/fix-api 

- After you have completed your issue"
  1. pull the code from main and then merge it with your branch
  2. ALWAYS PULL BEFORE you push(to get new changes) and fix merge conflicts.
  3. Push your changes ONLY to your branch.
  4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to main branch and tag me if I'm not already tagged.
