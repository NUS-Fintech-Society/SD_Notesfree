## Development Workflow (credits to jovyn)
DO NOT WORK on the main branch directly!

Follow the format of  "name/what-you-are-doing"

e.g. leah/fix-api 

git command to create a new branch:

git checkout main 
git checkout -b leah/fix-api (-b creates a new branch)

git command to move to branch one already created:
git checkout leah/fix-api 

After you have completed your issue, pull the code from main and then merge it with your branch

ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH and fix merge conflicts.

Push your changes ONLY to your branch.

Open a Pull Request (PR) to main branch and tag me if I'm not already tagged.
