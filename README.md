Read more here : https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/

##  Postman rules

Create a collection called "Notesfree" and clearly name every endpoint appropriately

## Development Workflow
DO NOT WORK on the main branch directly!

Follow the format of  "name/what-you-are-doing"

e.g. john/fix-endpoint

git command to create a new branch:

git checkout main 
git checkout -b leah/fix-api (-b creates a new branch)

git command to move to branch one already created:
git checkout leah/fix-api 

After you have completed your issue, pull the code from main and then merge it with your branch

ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH and fix merge conflicts.

Push your changes ONLY to your branch.

Open a Pull Request (PR) to main branch and tag me if I'm not already tagged.
